                <h3>Jiří Matas</h3>
                <p>Jiří Matas is the head of the Visual Recognition Group at the Center for Machine Perception, CTU Prague. His research interests include various facets of visual recognition and reconstruction, with a recent focus on adapting non-differentiable objectives or replacing them with suitable surrogates. He has received several best paper awards at international conferences on computer vision. He is a co-author of several international patents and a co-founder of a spin-off and a start-up company. 
                    Prof. Matas has been a partner in EU collaborative research projects and an evaluator for ERC and EU FP proposals. He contributes as an editor of leading journals in computer vision and pattern recognition. </p>
                <p><strong>Topic of Talk: </strong>Robust Recognition with Image Decomposition.</p>

                <h3>Petra Bevandic</h3>
                <p>Petra Bevandic has completed her MSc degree in 2014 and worked as a software developer till 2017. She defended her PhD thesis 
                    in open-set semantic segmentation at UniZg-FER in 2023. She is currently at the University of Bielefeld where she received NRW KI-Starter funding for her project Leveraging class relations for multi-dataset semantic segmentation. Her research addresses robust and interpretable dense recognition models, multi-dataset and multi-modal training, and transferability across tasks and domains. Her achievements include an Editor's Choice Article in Image Vision and Computing, and the best paper  
                    at the BMVC 2022 Workshop on Universal Representations in Computer Vision.

                <h3>Robert Geirhos</h3>
                <p>Dr. Robert Geirhos is a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind, located in Toronto. He obtained his PhD on comparing human and machine vision from the University of Tübingen and the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems, where he worked with Felix Wichmann, Matthias Bethge and Wieland Brendel. His research has received the ELLIS PhD award and an Outstanding Paper Award at NeurIPS. Inspired by research on human visual perception, Robert aims to develop a better understanding of the hypotheses, biases and assumptions of modern machine vision systems, and to use this understanding to make them more robust, interpretable and reliable.</p>
                <p><strong>Topic of Talk: </strong>What is the best paradigm to robustly recognize objects under challenging circumstances - discriminative inference (fast but potentially prone to shortcut learning) or using a generative model (slow but potentially more robust)?</p>
