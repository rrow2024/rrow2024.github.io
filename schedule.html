                <h3>Jiří Matas</h3>
                <p>Jiří Matas is the head of the Visual Recognition Group at the Center for Machine Perception, CTU Prague. His research interests include various facets of visual recognition and reconstruction, with a recent focus on adapting non-differentiable objectives or replacing them with suitable surrogates. He has received several best paper awards at international conferences on computer vision. He is a co-author of several international patents and a co-founder of a spin-off and a start-up company. 
                    Prof. Matas has been a partner in EU collaborative research projects and an evaluator for ERC and EU FP proposals. He contributes as an editor of leading journals in computer vision and pattern recognition. </p>

                <h3>Petra Bevandic</h3>
                <p>Petra Bevandic has completed her MSc degree in 2014 and worked as a software developer till 2017. She defended her PhD thesis 
                    in open-set semantic segmentation at UniZg-FER in 2023. She is currently at the University of Bielefeld where she received NRW KI-Starter funding for her project Leveraging class relations for multi-dataset semantic segmentation. Her research addresses robust and interpretable dense recognition models, multi-dataset and multi-modal training, and transferability across tasks and domains. Her achievements include an Editor's Choice Article in Image Vision and Computing, and the best paper  
                    at the BMVC 2022 Workshop on Universal Representations in Computer Vision.

                <h3>Robert Geirhos</h3>
                <p>Robert Geirhos has completed his PhD studies at the Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems, and the University of Tübingen. He was a research intern at FAIR / Meta AI and is currently with Google DeepMind. His research studies the limits 
                    of visual recognition models, the biases that they incorporate, and the underlying patterns behind their success. He strives to identify areas where our models fall short of the human visual system as a first step towards making them more interpretable, robust and reliable. He has been awarded with the ELLIS PhD Award, Outstanding Paper Award at NeurIPS, and has had seven oral presentations at ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML and VSS.</p>
