                <h3>Petra Bevandić</h3>
                <p>Petra Bevandić has completed her MSc degree in 2014 and worked as a software developer till 2017. She defended her PhD thesis 
                    in open-set semantic segmentation at UniZg-FER in 2023. She is currently at the University of Bielefeld where she received NRW KI-Starter funding for her project Leveraging class relations for multi-dataset semantic segmentation. Her research addresses robust and interpretable dense recognition models, multi-dataset and multi-modal training, and transferability across tasks and domains. Her achievements include an Editor's Choice Article in Image Vision and Computing, and the best paper  
                    at the BMVC 2022 Workshop on Universal Representations in Computer Vision.

                <h3>Toby Breckon</h3>
                <p>Toby Breckon is Professor of Computer Vision, and Head of Visual Computing, at Durham University where he leads research spanning sensing for autonomous road vehicles, robotic perception, automated visual surveillance and security X-ray image understanding with a strong emphasis on generalized machine learning and pattern recognition techniques.<br>
                Work from his research team has had significant impact in the aviation security sector, securing 500+ million passengers globally per annum, within the advent of multi-modal wide-area surveillance (UK SAPIENT programme, 2013-2016; MoD Grand Challenge - R.J. Mitchell Trophy, (2008), IET Innovation Award (2009)) and in sensing systems for future intelligent transport. He received the Royal Photographic Society Selwyn Award for early-career contribution to imaging science (2011).<br>
                Prof. Breckon holds a PhD in informatics (computer vision) from the University of Edinburgh.  He has been a visiting member of faculty at the Ecole Supérieure des Technologies Industrielles Avancées (France), Northwestern Polytechnical University (China), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (China) and Waseda University (Japan).<br>
                Prof. Breckon is a Chartered Engineer, Chartered Scientist and Fellow of both the British Computer Society (FBCS) and Institute for Engineering & Technology (FIET). In addition, he is an Accredited Senior Imaging Scientist and Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society (ASIS FRPS).</p>

                <h3>Robert Geirhos</h3>
                <p>Dr. Robert Geirhos is a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind, located in Toronto. He obtained his PhD on comparing human and machine vision from the University of Tübingen and the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems, where he worked with Felix Wichmann, Matthias Bethge and Wieland Brendel. His research has received the ELLIS PhD award and an Outstanding Paper Award at NeurIPS. Inspired by research on human visual perception, Robert aims to develop a better understanding of the hypotheses, biases and assumptions of modern machine vision systems, and to use this understanding to make them more robust, interpretable and reliable.</p>
