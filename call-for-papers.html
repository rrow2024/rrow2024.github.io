    <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
    <p>Prepare an anonymous paper of no more than 9 pages (excluding references) according to the <a href="https://bmvc2024.org/authors/submit-your-paper/">BMVC 2024 submission guidelines</a>. Make sure to use the corresponding <a href="https://bmvc2024.org/authors/submit-your-paper/#typesetting">\(\mathrm{\LaTeX{}}\)-template</a>.</p>
    <p>Unlike the main conference's submission guidelines, you do not require a paper ID. Simply keep the PDF version of your paper anonymous while entering your name in the submission form. This also means you will submit your abstract and full paper at the same time.</p>
    <p>Submissions are handled via the workshop's OpenReview conference, which you can find here:</p>
    <div class="container">
        <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=bmva.org/BMVC/2024/Workshop/RROW" class="btn-primary">Submit via OpenReview</a>
    </div>
